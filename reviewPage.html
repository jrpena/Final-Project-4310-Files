		Fan arrived in good condition. Looks like a Honeywell HT908 But has the blades and motor power of a Vornado. 
		It is a good mid-size, and can do well on a table or on the floor: the sound level is decent on level 2 and level 1 is very quiet. 
		Level 3 is loud but delivers a nice focused gust of air. I have it blowing at a wall above my sofa and it’s definitely circulating air. 
		I can feel a general airiness in my space. My plants are moving around so that’s a sign air is moving for me. 
		Excited to use this as a way to get my air conditioner air traveling the room more evenly.
		I’m also pretty impressed by the build.
		All plastic but doesn’t feel flimsy or cheap. 
		For ~26$ You’re getting a solid air circulator with a 55watt PSC motor. 
		Something you don’t usually see in this price range. 
		Can’t decide on the budget friendly but cheaply made Honeywell or the robust quality yet pricey Vornado? AmazonBasics is your best of both worlds.

			5.0 out of 5 stars Love it, just like a Vornado<p>

		</h3>
		I returned a Vornado fan that is similar in size as this fan for various reasons, 
		and this fan performs the same but at a lower cost. 
		I highly recommend it. I am sure the mechanism to angle it will eventually break like the Honeywell fans, but I will just buy a new one when that happens. I wish they would just use the easier design where you tighten a knob to angle and lock it in place. It is very quiet, and even on the medium and high setting it doesn't have as much as a loud fan noise as other fans. When paired with a space heater it actually fills the area with heat. 
		I am very happy with this purchase.

			5.0 out of 5 stars Great Small Fan <p>
			Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019<p>

		</h3> 
		This is a positive review, as are most of the reviews of this fan. As I type this, the fan is 10 feet or so away and is giving me a very nice breeze in my living room. It is actually my second AmazonBasics Air-Circulator Small Room Floor Fan, as I liked the first one so much. I bought this fan because my Vornado 660 just died one day. The Vornado has electronic controls, as opposed to a mechanical switch. I do not want to attempt to fix it, especially now that I have this AmazonBasics fan. It is not a Vornado, but for the $$, there is a lot of bang for the buck. I included a photo comparing its relative size to the Vornado 660. Pretty comparable. I have the fan on the 2nd speed setting. It is not super quiet, nor super noisy. I like the sound of a fan. It has a consistent hum. For my needs, this will replace the Vornado quite nicely. To address some of the negative comments: 1) "Not a floor fan.": It can go on the floor or a table. It seems large for a table though. Works perfectly fine on the floor. Has 3 or 4 tilting positions that lock in place. 2) "Does not blow enough air.": It blows pretty well for its small size. I have not even put it on the highest speed setting yet. 3) "The locking mechanism seems cheap; may break.": Okay. Anything MAY happen, but I can't see the mechanism breaking unless you are constantly moving it. I generally just turn it on and off and leave it in the position I like. 4) "Not a 16 inch fan.": Well... nowhere does it say 16 inches. It is a 14 inch fan. That is the diameter of the actual blade housing. The blades themselves are about 12.5 across. The height is 16 inches and the width is 14 inches, which is actually the width of the stand. 5) "I thought it would be bigger.": These are my favorite low star reviews. Not a defect in the fan because someone did not read the dimensions. There are no deceiving pictures.
		Great price for a great fan. I use one in the bedroom (my dog gets hot at night) and one in the living room. Saves on the air conditioning. I highly recommend this fan. Light, durable, good air circulation.

		 So I had this old Honeywell fan that I've been using for about the past year. It has served me well, mostly used to keep me cool while working in my little home shop. But... I wanted to grab another one to keep in my bedroom. It's starting to heat up around here and these little fans do a lot in terms of circulating air-conditioned air.
		I've uploaded a little video comparison between the two in terms of sound. Since I was looking to place this one in my bedroom, I was definitely looking for something a bit quieter. And let me tell you... in terms of noise, this fan does NOT disappoint! I mean it's so awesomely quiet that I actually took the time to write an amazon review about it! AND upload a video... I basically never upload video reviews.
		Check out the video to see the sound comparison. NOTE: The audio on the video really doesn't do it justice because my phone automatically reduces the microphone volume when it hears something loud and raises the mic volume when it's quiet. After reviewing the video myself, it definitely did that in this case because that old Honeywell fan is much louder than it appears on the video.
		In terms of airflow, they're about the same... BUT... this Amazon fan is definitely less expensive than the Honeywell and seems like it's even better quality (even when the Honeywell was brand new, it was loud).
